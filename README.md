The app is basiclly runs off the Json file that was mailed along with the assignment, due to the lack of time i wasnt able to complete it . but i did a achive some level of functionality such taht the application loads with the rendered list mounted on a side menu along with the ability to click on it gives you information about the city due to the lack of time i didnt get to put much of the information drom the json to the display but i showed that if i can do one of the infos with time i can retrive the rest as well, th eprogram also allows users to take notes on the city but with no effective backend the data is lost once refreshed.

To improve this project if given the time i can ceate a backend with a responssive ralational database thats connected with each user given a unque id with authentacation along with each users list of comments and to each location the comments/notes are paired making it a sort of social network, if given more time i an also make the page more interactive and user friendly. along with fully parcing the data and information.

In the application once you place a comment, you can edit it after by placing a new coomment in the edit textbox then pressing edit.
